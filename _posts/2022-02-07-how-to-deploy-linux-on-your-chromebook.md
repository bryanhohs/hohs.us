The best linux distro we have right now is GalliumOS. It's designed for running linux on a chromebook. It's another Ubuntu linux flavor with support for chromebook hardware. We might have other distros out there but GalliumOS simplifies the installation out the box.

Before we move on, make sure you have enabled [Developer Mode](https://hohs.us/posts/how-to-enable-chromebook-developer-mode) and installed [Mr Chromebox firmware](https://hohs.us/posts/how-to-install-mr-chromebox-firmware).

1. Dowload the latest iso for your chromebook and flash it to a [USB disk](https://hohs.us/posts/how-to-make-a-bootable-iso-image).
2. Boot the USB disk via Mr Chromebox's firmware.
3. Follow the prompts and install GalliumOS.

Reboot your chromebook and you're all set to run linux on chrome!

Enjoy!
