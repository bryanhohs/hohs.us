Twitter has been testing out their tip jar the past year and it's now available for iOS and Android users. Other Twitter users can send tips via several 3rd party payment services which include Bitcoin, Ethereum, CashApp, Venmo, and Strike.

1. On iOS or Android, go to "Edit Profile"
2. Then tap "Tips"
3. Add your 3rd party usernames
4. Click Save

You must be at least 18 years old to request, receive, or send tips on Twitter so use it wisely.

Enjoy!
