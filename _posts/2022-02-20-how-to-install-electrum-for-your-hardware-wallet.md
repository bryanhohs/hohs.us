Electrum Bitcoin Wallet is the best wallet in my opinion. It's free, open source, and supports a handful of hardware wallets. It's available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. It has Tor network integration and gives you more control over the device. A must have for anyone serious about Bitcoin. Download, install, and you're ready to go!
