The Raspberry Pi 4 UEFI Firmware is still pretty new. It enables the install of several systems that require additional firmware. This includes FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Microsoft Windows 10 (Windows PE) and Linux distributions. It also allows us to boot directly from usb.

1. Download the latest archive from the pftf/RPi4 releases [repository](https://github.com/pftf/RPi4/releases).
2. Format your micro sd card with a FAT32 filesystem.
3. Extract the firmware to the root directory of the sd card.

Enjoy!
